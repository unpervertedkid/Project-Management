## Roadmap
The Project will be impemented using the Iterative incremental model.Its SDLC roadmap is as follows:
1. System conception.
2. Requirement specification.
3. Software design.
4. Coding/Implementation.
5. System integration.
6. Testing.
7. Software Quality assurance.
8. System installation.
9. Software maintainance.




 
## 1. System Conception
Every project needs a Project Management tool that can easily manage the budget, quality and documentation for projects. 

The Project Management software will be a web application that will enable teams to manage tasks, resources/funds, communicate and ultimately achieve the project goals.

PMs (Project Managers) can create a project schedule and track the progress.They can also  create a budget and track the project expenses all within one tool.
The software also involves Stakeholders who can view the project progress and current expenditure from their dashboard.

The software's objectives include:

1. To make Project Planning and Scheduling easier.
2. To Handle Project-related Information - the project planning software will provide information to team members,Project Managers and stakeholders. 
3. To provide data analytics and insights - from the software,you can view the deliverables, dependencies, scheduling drivers, and data changes for your project.
