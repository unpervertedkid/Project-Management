## System Conception
Every project needs a Project Management tool that can easily manage the budget, quality and documentation for projects. 
This Software is intended for project planning, scheduling, and resource allocation. It enables cost control, budget management, quality management, and document management for project managers (PMs), stakeholders, and users. It may also be used as an administration system. Software for project management is also utilized for stakeholder participation and communication.


The software's objectives include:

1. Schedulingâ€“The main objective is to schedule a series of events or tasks and the complexity of the schedule can vary considerably depending on how the tool is used.
2. Dealing with project related information-Project planning software can be expected to provide information to various people or stakeholders, and can be used to measure and justify the level of effort required to complete the project(s).
3. Gain visibility and insight-Visibility means you can easily find, analyze and report on all types of information about your projects. This introduces features to help you gain visibility of your project's deliverables, dependencies, schedule drivers, and changes to data.
4. Communicate and collaborate-The project management software enhances information sharing and coordination among project teams for better participation, progress reporting, and collaboration.
Quality -Software project management activity must be highly organized and thoroughly planned. Efficient project management software will greatly improve the overall output.


    Therefore,the Software will handle:
- Task management.
-  Resource management.
- Collaboration.
- File sharing.
- Project planning.
